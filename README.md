# Super basic Expo / React Native chat

This is the most basic implementation of a chat app using react native. It includes a simple server that uses websockets and a read and add API methods to communicate with the app. The app is a simple chat interface that allows you to send messages to the server and receive messages from the server. The server is based on express and uses redis to store messages. The front end has 2 screens, one for the chat and one for the login. The chat screen is a simple list of messages and a text input to send messages. The login screen is a simple form with a text input for the username and a button to submit the form. Message bubble color changes based on the user. The app supports light and dark mode.
